# Crystal-Kemal

This is the [Kemal](https://github.com/sdogruyol/kemal) test of the Framework Benchmarks. Crystal is a new language that closely resembles Ruby with a goal of removing typed variables and parameters (instead inferencing), whilst maintaining top speed through bindings into C.

Kemal is a fast and simple web framework for Crystal language. Inspired by Sinatra but with superior performance and built-in WebSocket support.
